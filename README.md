Marvel Superhero hunter

This project uses vanilla JS, html and CSS. HTML and css is used for styling and mainly establishing a link between the pages to build a flow.

Vanilla JS is used for fetching the superhero details via API and displaying the details upto 5 at a time based on user entered text, where user can click on the superhero they want to know about and even they can add them in their favourite list.

User can directly visit favourite list via a favourite button where all users favourite superheroes will be stored. They can be removed from favourite list and even view more information about them via favourite button as well.

Also User can change the theme of the website i.e. either dark or light but by default the theme will be light when webiste is loaded.

On the home page background image will be diplayed at random whenver the home page is loaded.
